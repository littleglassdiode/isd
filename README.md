===========================

Compiling
---------

To build, first set the following variables in `default/makefile` accordingly:
    KERNEL_DIR     location of Uzebox kernel
    UZEBIN_DIR     location of compiled Uzebox utilities
Once this is done, the game should compile by running `make` from the `default`
directory.

ISD was developed with avr-gcc 4.7.2 and Uzebox kernel 3.3, but it may work
with different versions of the aforementioned software.
